# Linux FTP Client - Project Notes

## Overview
A WinSCP-like FTP/SFTP client for Linux with integrated terminal support, built with Electron.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Connection Management
- **Multi-protocol support**: FTP, FTPS, SFTP
- **Connection profiles**: Save/load with encrypted password storage
- **Authentication methods**: Password and SSH key authentication
- **Connection status**: Real-time status updates
- **Multi-tab support**: Connect to multiple servers simultaneously

### 2. File Management
- **Dual-pane interface**: Local and remote file browsers
- **Navigation**: Double-click to open folders (prevents accidental navigation)
- **File selection**: Single-click to select files
- **File search**: Real-time filtering in both panels
- **Right-click context menus**:
  - Upload/Download (files and folders)
  - Rename
  - Delete (with confirmation)
  - Permissions (SFTP only)
  - Refresh

### 3. File Transfer
- **Transfer Queue**: Advanced queue management system
  - Pause/resume individual transfers
  - Global pause/resume all
  - Progress tracking with speed
  - Concurrent transfers (up to 3)
  - Error handling and retry
- **Upload/Download**: Via buttons, drag & drop, or context menu
- **Recursive operations**: Upload/download entire folder structures
- **Drag & Drop support**:
  - Internal: Drag from local panel to remote panel
  - External: Drag files/folders from file manager
  - Visual feedback with highlighting

### 4. Terminal Integration
- **Automatic terminal**: Opens for SFTP connections
- **SSH shell**: Direct shell access through ssh2 library
- **Terminal reconnect**: Button to reconnect dropped sessions
- **Integrated xterm.js**: Full terminal emulator in the app

### 5. Permissions Management (SFTP only)
- **Visual editor**: Checkboxes for Owner/Group/Other permissions
- **Octal notation**: Direct input and display
- **Live updates**: Changes between checkboxes and octal are synchronized

### 6. Multi-Tab Interface
- **Tab management**: Create, switch, close tabs
- **Independent sessions**: Each tab maintains its own connection
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: 
  - Ctrl/Cmd+T: New tab
  - Ctrl/Cmd+W: Close tab
  - Ctrl/Cmd+Tab: Next tab
  - Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Tab: Previous tab
  - Ctrl/Cmd+1-9: Switch to specific tab
- **Visual indicators**: Active tab highlighting, hover effects

### 7. Search Functionality
- **Real-time search**: Filter files as you type
- **Case-insensitive**: Searches match any case
- **Clear button**: Quick reset of search
- **Status updates**: Shows match count
- **Auto-clear**: Resets when changing directories

## Technical Architecture

### Main Process (`src/main/`)
- `index.js`: Electron main process, IPC handlers
- `connectionManager.js`: Handles FTP/SFTP connections
- `profileManager.js`: Manages saved connection profiles
- `menu.js`: Application menu structure

### Renderer Process (`src/renderer/`)
- `index.html`: UI structure with modals for connections and permissions
- `styles.css`: Dark theme styling
- `renderer.js`: UI logic, event handling, file operations

### Dependencies
- **electron**: Desktop application framework
- **ssh2**: SFTP/SSH connections
- **basic-ftp**: FTP/FTPS connections
- **xterm**: Terminal emulator
- **electron-store**: Encrypted profile storage
- **uuid**: Connection ID generation

## Security Considerations
- Content Security Policy implemented
- Password encryption for saved profiles
- No sandbox mode for terminal functionality
- Secure connection handling

## Known Limitations
1. Terminal only works with SFTP connections (not FTP)
2. Permissions management only for SFTP
3. No recursive directory operations
4. No file preview functionality

## Usage Tips
1. **Double-click** folders to navigate (single-click only selects)
2. **Drag files** from local to remote panel for quick upload
3. **Right-click** for context menu options
4. **Save profiles** with "Save as" field when connecting
5. **Test connection** button helps diagnose issues
